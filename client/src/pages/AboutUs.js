    <h2> Mission</h2>
    <p> Our mission is to empower families with children to transition from homelessness to self-sufficiency by providing case management, housing, food, training and educational resources in a secure enviroment.</p>
    <h2> History</h2>
    <p>St. Francis House was established in 1980 by Father Baker. His goal was to provide the necessities to help the impoverished and hungry in his community</p>
    <h2>The Structure of St. Francis House </h2>
    <p> The current Board has 10 members, some of whom have been on the board for 15+ years. </p>

    <h2> What does St. Francis House Provide? </h2>
    <ul>
    <li> Temporary Emergency Shelter for Families with Children: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>  St. Francis House houses 35 - 40 shelter guests, with preference given to families</li>
        <li> Typically, guests stay for an average of 2-4 weeks. </li>
      </ul>
    <li> Case management:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>  St. Francis House has two case managers on site, who also oversee our two other properties.</li>
        <li>  Guests are required to meet regularly with the case manager and set up individualized case plans.</li>
        <li>  Case managers refer guests to local community resources that best meet their immediate needs.</li>
        <li>  Homelessness is a complex social problem - more than 60% of homeless adults reported being homeless at least one or more times as a child. St Francis House is trying to break this cycle by teaching self-sufficiency.</li>
        <li>    On average, 33% of employable residents find jobs before or upon discharge and 25% have jobs when they became residents.</li>
     </ul>
    <li>Meal Service:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>  Breakfast is served to shelter residents from 6.00a - 7.00a. </li>
        <li>  Lunch is served from 9.00a-12.00p every day. Lunch is provided to anyone who needs it that has police clearance, not just shelter residents.</li>
        <li> Dinner is usually provided by service groups or community organizations (for shelter resident only) starting at 6.00p every night.</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
